* Pyscratch
yep ._. It is what you think it is.

Scratch-to-python translator, aimed at making scratch a /useable/ (not /useful/) language for scientific computing and machine learning
** Goals
These are my goals for what scratch with pyscratch should be capable of, and serves as a TODO list
- [X] Create and set variables
- [X] Define and call procedures (one or zero arguments)
- [ ] Define and call procedures (more than one argument)
- [ ] Store function return values in a non-hacky way (can be done hackily by assigning a variable to a normal python function call)
- [ ] Non-hacky arithmetic expressions
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Conditions/Control-flow
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Import python libraries
- [ ] Classes from python libraries
- [ ] Enable use of builtin python functions
- [ ] Clean up code
